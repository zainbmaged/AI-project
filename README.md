# Gobblet Gobblers
We will explore the game-playing of Gobblet, Gobblet is an abstract game
played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on
top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.
Your goal in Gobblet is to place four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed
piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other
spot where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece
played off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a row
where your opponent has three of his colour.
Your memory is tested as you try to remember which colour one of your larger pieces is
covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four like-coloured pieces in a row,
he wins â€” except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that
finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its
starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in
that row, the game continues.
